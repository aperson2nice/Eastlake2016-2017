# Eastlake2017-2018

This repository contains sample projects for a basics in python course at Eastalke High School's SATA program.
Below is a description of the projects and what lessons are covered with those projects.

~--------------------------------~
Alphabet Project
Problem: Fonts for the text based output of python are bland and boring
Solution: Create a program that takes text as input and outputs the text using "fancy" lettering stored in a file.
Files in the project: 
  Alphabet.txt - contains the alphabet in a "Fancy" way
  RunFancy.py - is the file to run. To run with a different alphabet, update the LETTER_HEIGHT variable. 
  Future Imporovements: Add a GUI
                        Make output to a file
